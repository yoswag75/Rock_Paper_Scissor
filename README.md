# ✋🤚✌️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with Hand Gesture Detection

This project leverages the power of OpenCV to create a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game! 🎮 Using computer vision, it detects hand movements and recognizes whether the user has chosen rock ✊, paper 🖐️, or scissors ✌️.

## Features:

- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV to analyze and detect your hand gestures in real-time. 👁️👋
- **Game Logic**: Compares the detected hand gesture with a randomly generated choice by the computer. 🎲
- **Scoring System**: Points are allocated based on the outcome of each round. Win, lose, or tie, your score updates accordingly! 🏆📊
- **Interactive and Fun**: A seamless blend of technology and classic gameplay, providing an engaging user experience. 🎉

## How It Works:

1. **Hand Detection**: The camera captures your hand gesture.
2. **Gesture Recognition**: OpenCV processes the image and identifies your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
3. **Computer's Choice**: The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
4. **Outcome Comparison**: Your gesture is compared with the computer's choice, and points are awarded based on the result.
